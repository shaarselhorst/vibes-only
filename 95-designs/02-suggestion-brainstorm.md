This app wants to give users ideas for coding objectives. It does not focus on the technology, but only app ideas. 
These ideas are hardcoded, prefixed in a json. I want a lot of them. So our objective is to complete this document to generate new ideas. Lets make a list of popular hobbies, branches in the industry, activities that one may do. Lets make an exhaustive list of each of those, lets make many categories, and make many ideas per category. This document should convey a mindset. each of the actions should be actionable by the common person. The idea should be something they can start creating an app for today, to try launch an app in their specific intrest. The intrest comming from our website that is. Lets say, i want to create a TODO app, or a kanban board, or a scrumboard, or wanna provide a service to walk my dog, or shelter animals, or I like football, painting, racing cards, want to make an app where people can register, sell something provide a service of any kind, start a forum, start a chatting app. Some of these ideas are too hard. I have one very very important remark about the kind of ideas we generate. We should only create ideas that an AI would be able to understand, like, the prompt we create for the idea, should be actionable by an AI. So these apps have to be simple. No more than a few pages or even a single page app. These ideas, they do not talk about technologies or even if it is for an android app, a web app, or desktop app, etc. We only share the ideas, not how to actually implement it. So an idea would be 'I want people to sign up for my dog walking service', we did not mention the technology, we could desribe what information may be relevant, or what should be supported, without specifiying how that would be achieved. So, lets reconstruct this document with these thoughts in mind and fine tune it as we go.

1. Create a list of hobbies, industries, branches, intrests, activities
2. Describe what an idea would like like in one of these topics, what is is, and what it is not
3. Create example ideas, adhering to the idea.ts type
