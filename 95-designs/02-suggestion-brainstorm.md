# App Idea Generation Framework

## Core Philosophy

This app generates **simple, actionable app ideas** that focus on **what** users want to build, not **how** to build it. Ideas should be:

- **AI-understandable**: Simple enough for AI to generate code from
- **Single-page or few-page apps**: No complex multi-screen applications
- **Technology-agnostic**: Focus on functionality, not implementation details
- **Immediately actionable**: Users can start building today
- **Interest-driven**: Based on hobbies, industries, and personal passions

- **User actions**: What can users do with it?
- **Data elements**: What information is relevant?
- **Real-world context**: How does it fit into daily life?

### What an Idea Should NOT Include
- **Technology specifications**: No mention of web/mobile/desktop
- **Implementation details**: No specific frameworks or databases
- **Complex workflows**: No multi-step processes or advanced features
- **Business models**: No monetization or pricing strategies
- **Technical requirements**: No performance or scalability concerns

### Example Idea Format
```typescript
{
  "id": "simple-identifier",
  "title": "Clear, Actionable Title",
  "summary": "One sentence describing what the app does",
  "objective": "Detailed explanation of the app's purpose and features",
  "tags": ["relevant", "categories", "for", "filtering"]
}
```

## 3. Sample Ideas by Category

### Sports & Fitness
```typescript
{
  "id": "workout-tracker",
  "title": "Simple Workout Tracker",
  "summary": "Track daily workouts with exercises, sets, and reps.",
  "objective": "Users can log their workouts by selecting exercises from a predefined list, recording sets and reps, and viewing their workout history. The app should support basic exercises like push-ups, squats, and planks.",
  "tags": ["fitness", "tracking", "health"]
}
```

### Creative Arts
```typescript
{
  "id": "art-gallery",
  "title": "Personal Art Gallery",
  "summary": "Upload and organize your artwork with descriptions and categories.",
  "objective": "Users can upload images of their artwork, add titles and descriptions, organize them into categories (paintings, drawings, digital art), and view their collection in a gallery format.",
  "tags": ["art", "gallery", "organization"]
}
```

### Local Services
```typescript
{
  "id": "dog-walking-service",
  "title": "Dog Walking Service",

}
```

## 4. Idea Generation Guidelines

### Keep It Simple
- **Single purpose**: One main function per app
- **Minimal features**: 3-5 features maximum
- **Clear user flow**: Linear, straightforward user experience
- **Familiar patterns**: Use common UI patterns users already know

### Make It Actionable
- **Immediate value**: Users can see benefit from first use
- **Real-world context**: Solves actual problems people have
- **Personal connection**: Tied to interests users care about
- **Quick setup**: Minimal configuration required

### Ensure AI Compatibility
- **Clear requirements**: Specific, unambiguous functionality
- **Standard patterns**: Common app structures and workflows
- **Limited scope**: Manageable complexity for code generation
- **Well-defined data**: Clear data structures and relationships

*Remember: The goal is to inspire users to build something meaningful to them, not to overwhelm them with complex requirements. Every idea should feel achievable and exciting.*
