### Vibes Only – Project Idea Spinner (Concept)

#### 1) What I’m trying to make
I want a tiny, playful page that helps me get moving when I’m stuck choosing what to build. There’s one big button. I press it, and I get a concise, ready‑to‑start project idea. No overthinking, no rabbit holes—just a spark I can act on right away.

- **Primary action**: I click “Start vibing!” to get a fresh idea.
- **Primary output**: A simple card with a clear title and a short, actionable description.
- **Expectation**: It should feel instant and work even if I’m offline.

#### 2) Why this matters to me
- **Simplicity**: I don’t want to set up or think about anything—just click and go.
- **Reliability**: The ideas should always be there when I need them.
- **Clarity**: Each idea should be scoped enough that I can start building immediately.
- **Delight**: The vibe should be modern, friendly, and fun.

#### 3) Who I’m making this for
- **As a learner**, I want to get an idea instantly so I can practice and build momentum.
- **As a maker who uses AI tools**, I want small prompts that are concrete and doable.

#### 4) How it works
- The page carries a small set of curated ideas with it, so a new idea appears instantly.
- When I press the button, I get a random idea.
- If I just saw one idea, it shouldn’t repeat immediately.

#### 5) What an idea looks like
- A stable identifier (for internal reference and possible future features).
- A short title.
- A summary
- A crisp 1–3 sentence description that tells me how to start.
- A handful of tags that hint at the theme or skills involved.

#### 6) Risks I’m watching
- **Idea quality**: If the ideas are bland, the whole experience falls flat → I’ll curate and iterate.
- **Repetition perception**: If repeats feel frequent, it will feel small → I’ll keep the immediate repeat guard and expand the idea set over time.

#### 7) Definition of Done (MVP)
- The page runs, I click once, and I get a useful idea with no consecutive repeats.
- Ideas live inside the experience; there’s no account, no setup, and no waiting.
- The whole thing is easy to maintain and extend with more ideas later.
