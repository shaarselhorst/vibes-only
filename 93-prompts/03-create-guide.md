Execute the "Get Started Guide" implementation strictly per `95-designs/03-guide-concept.md`.

- Create a new route `/example` with component `Example`.
- Add a subtle header button labeled "Guide" next to the existing header button; outline-only, text-only styling (no gradients/animations).
- On `/example`, render the eight numbered steps from the design doc as a clean, minimal, responsive numbered list.
- Ensure the result meets the Acceptance criteria in the design doc (button placement/style, route renders the steps, layout is clean and responsive).
