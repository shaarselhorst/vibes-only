# Generate Creative App Ideas

## Task
Generate unique, creative app ideas that follow our one-hour development constraint. Each idea should be in its own JSON file in the `data/ideas/` directory.

## Context
You are using our **App Idea Generation Framework** (see `95-designs/02-suggestion-brainstorm.md` for complete guidelines and constraints).

## File Naming
Name each file descriptively:
- `plant-watering-tracker.json`
- `recipe-cost-calculator.json`
- `parking-spot-memory.json`

## Quality Checklist
Before creating each idea, ask yourself:
1. Can this be built in one hour by AI?
2. Does it solve a real, specific problem?
3. Is it creative and unique?
4. Does it have 2-3 clear, simple features?
5. Would someone actually want to use this?

## Start Creating
Now generate creative, one-hour-scoped app ideas. Make each one unique, interesting, and immediately actionable for users with specific interests or daily challenges.
