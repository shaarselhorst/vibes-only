# Project Structure

## Rules
- Organize source under `src/` with these top-level folders when needed:
  - `components/` reusable UI
  - `composables/` reusable logic (`useXyz`)
  - `routes/` or `views/` for page-level components
  - `assets/` for imported images/fonts (fingerprinted by Vite)
  - `types/` central TypeScript types
- Name Vue components in `PascalCase` and composables as `useThing` in `camelCase`.
- Keep public, raw-served files in `public/` (no imports needed).
- Prefer small components over deeply nested ones. Extract and reuse instead of adding conditional branches.
- Keep entry points minimal (`main.ts` bootstraps app, registers plugins, mounts root component only).

## Example
```text
src/
  assets/
  components/
  composables/
  types/
  App.vue
  main.ts
```
